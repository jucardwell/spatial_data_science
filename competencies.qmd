# Course Competencies

##  Concept 1: Data Science & Data Acquisition

**Guiding Question:** What is data science, and how do we acquire data for analysis?

-   Explain the purpose of data science and describe each stage in a typical data science workflow
-   Identify types of spatial data providers and explain the differences between “old-school” and “new-school” data acquisition.
-   Determine what each row in a dataset represents (the unit of analysis) and identify the type of each variable
-   Identify the main characteristics of data quality, bias, and representativeness and how these influence whether a dataset is fit for a particular use

## Concept 2: Tidy Data and Early Exploration

**Guiding Question:** How do we structure and explore data effectively?

-   Explain the relationship between general programming concepts and tidyverse abstractions for data wrangling
-   Identify the major components of “tidy” data
-   Use basic tidyverse functions (select, filter, mutate, rename) to manipulate a dataset
-   Create basic visualizations ( non-map graphics) of a variable
-   Generate and interpret descriptive statistics of a variable

## Concept 3: Spatial Data

**Guiding Question:** How is spatial data unique?

-   Describe spatial dependence, spatial heterogeneity, and distance decay, and explain why they make spatial data unique
-   Describe the main components of vector and raster data structures and how they relate to conceptual models of the world (field and object)
-   Explain the characteristics of geographic and projected coordinate systems and their importance for spatial analysis
-   Evaluate the impact of MAUP and ecological fallacy on spatial data analysis and the conclusions drawn from aggregated data
-   Create basic maps of a variable
-   Calculate basic spatial descriptive statistics

## Concept 4: Asking Spatial Questions

**Guiding Question:** How do spatial questions guide spatial data science, and how do they shape analytical datasets?

-   Generate a spatial research question and connect it to specific spatial data requirements
-   Explain the distinction between raw data and analytical data
-   Determine the data transformations required to convert raw spatial data into analytical datasets that can address specific spatial questions

## Concept 5: Wrangling Data

**Guiding Question:** How do we transform raw spatial data into datasets ready for analysis?

-   Use tidyverse tools to group, summarize, reshape, and join datasets
-   Use tidyverse tools to create derived variables and construct aggregations
-   Perform spatial joins, buffering operations, and distance calculations using sf tools
-   Detect and address missing data, duplicates, and invalid geometries
-   Apply the data transformations required to convert raw spatial data into analytical datasets that can address specific spatial questions

## Concept 6: Mapping

**Guiding Question:** How do we visualize spatial patterns in our analytical dataset and communicate them?

-   Create effective thematic maps using tmap, including layering, symbology, legends, and annotation
-   Select appropriate classification methods and evaluate how those choices affect interpretation

## Concept 7: AI in Programming

**Guiding Question:** How does AI change the way we write code and solve problems? How can we use AI tools effectively for coding and analysis? 

-   Explain how AI-assisted programming fits into modern data science workflows
-   Identify the strengths, limitations, and risks of using AI in spatial data science 
-   Create effective prompts that guide LLM tools towards effective code assistance
-   Apply GitHub Copilot to assist in writing, debugging, and documenting code
-   Assess the reliability and accuracy of AI-generated code

## Concept 8: Spatial Neighborhoods and Weights

**Guiding Question**: How do we quantify spatial relationships? 

-   Explain why different spatial weight and neighborhood definitions are used and how they influence analysis outcomes
-   Construct spatial weights and spatial weights matrices, justifying the choice of method for a specific analytical context

## Concept 9: Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA)

**Guiding Question:** How can we detect and interpret spatial patterns in data?

-   Calculate and interpret global and local spatial autocorrelation metrics (e.g., Moran’s I, LISA)
-   Conduct point pattern analysis using nearest-neighbor measures and density estimation
-   Identify and interpret clusters, hot spots, outliers, and distinguish random from structured spatial patterns.
-   Create bivariate maps to visualize and interpret spatial relationships between two variables
-   Use ESDA results to generate or refine hypotheses and research questions
